# MY NAME IS JOSEPH MIKHAIL
## ...I am a guitar fanatic...
### ... and I suppose I like cars as well...

This is a picture of a part of my guitar collection from almost two years ago. Unfortunately, I do not have the SG's on the right and left side anymore, but the guitar in the middle is my most prized possession. It's an American Professional Stratocastor and it is my nicest guitar. My amplifier is pretty cool as well - you can see it on the bottom right of the photo.
