# MY NAME IS JOSEPH MIKHAIL
## ...I am a guitar fanatic...
### ... and I suppose I like cars as well...

Below is a picture containing some of the guitars in my collection from almost two years ago. Unfortunately, I do not have the SG's on the right or left side anymore, but the guitar in the middle is my most prized possession. It's a Fender American Professional Stratocastor that costed me an arm and a leg. Needless to say it is my nicest guitar. My amplifier is pretty cool as well - you can see it on the bottom right of the photo.

I honestly love listening to all kinds of music in general and I love working on cars so I installed a subwoofer in my Toyota Corolla -> click below.

In fact, I love music so much that I stripped every bit of interior from my car and I put sound deadener everywhere! In the doors, on the floors, in the ceiling, and even in the trunk! I know I'm a freak, right?!
